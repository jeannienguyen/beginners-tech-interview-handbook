# Offers

You got an offer! Do you accept and sign it immediately? Should you renegotiate it? Depends on what your situation is.

Do your research. Find out the average salary for the title you're applying for based on where you live. If it's a remote role, it doesn't hurt to check out the salary for the city where the company is located.

I've negotiated some offers and other times I've accepted the initial offer. From someone who's accepted done both, I don't think it hurts to negotiate your offer. I've personally never heard of anyone getting their offer rescinded for negotiating and that majority of the time, it's expected.

### What to Review on Your Offer

* Base salary
* RSUs
* Time off policy
* Benefits

If you have any questions, your recruiter should be able to answer most, if not all, of your questions. If you have a mentor or friend in the same field, you can ask them for advice as well. If you're up for it, you can even have them review your offer.

### Other Things to Consider

Here are other things to consider when making a decision on an offer:

* Is the work interesting?
* Do you like the team? Is this the team you see yourself on?
* Growth/career opportunities within the company
* Work/life balance
* Company culture
* Perks

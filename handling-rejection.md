# Handling Rejection

Rejection is part of the game. You're not going to get a call back for every application you send out.  You can get rejected at any step of the interview process. Don't let yourself get stuck on the rejections. Just like you're looking for the best job for you, the companies are looking for the best candidate for them.

How you handle rejection partly determines how successful you'll be in your job hunt. Whether you get rejected after the initial technical screen or after the final round, you should try to get feedback from the interviewers. From past experience, it's a hit or miss. I've emailed recruiters after receiving a rejection email only to mostly receive radio silence. On the occasion the recruiter does decide to provide feedback, I make sure to keep note of it for my future interviews.

Knowing that you can be dropped from the interview process at any stage, make sure to keep applying for jobs. The job hunt isn't over until you've signed an offer. In the potential case of rescinded offers, make sure to have a backup plan.

# Note From the Author

This handbook was written with the intention of analyzing the tech interview process. I wanted to break down the steps it takes to get a job, from applying all the way to signing the offer. After having repeated the job hunt 3+ times, I wanted to share my experience so that maybe it can help someone else down the line.

If this handbook has helped you land a job, drop me a line! I'd love to hear about it.

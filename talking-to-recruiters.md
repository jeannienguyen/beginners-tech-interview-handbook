# Talking to Recruiters

After applying for jobs, if you stand out to the recruiter for that role, you'll get an email invite for the initial recruiter call.

I tend to schedule these as soon as possible. The sooner I can chat with the recruiter to see if this is a company I want to interview with (and vice versa), the quicker I can get the next step scheduled.

### How to Prepare for a Recruiter Call

* Have your resume handy for you to look at during the call
* Be prepared to answer questions (or some variation) like:
  * Tell me about yourself (quick introduction)
  * What are you looking for in your next job?
  * Why do you want to join \[company name]?
* Have your own questions ready for the recruiter, for example:
  * What does the interview process with \[company name] look like?
  * How long does the interview process take?
  * How big is the team? What's the frontend/backend split?
  * What projects is the team currently working on?
  * What does the career/growth ladder look like at \[company name]?
  * When can I expect to hear back (on next steps)?

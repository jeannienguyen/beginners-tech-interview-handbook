# Technical Screens

After the companies decide if there's an interest in moving you forward in the interview process, you'll either coordinate a time to speak to the hiring manager or do a technical screen.

### Speaking With the Hiring Manager

Be prepared to speak on the following:

* Your current/last job
* What you're good at (frontend/backend/etc)
* Projects that you made significant contributions to
* What you're looking for in your next role

### Technical Screens

There's many ways companies run their technical screens. I've seen some companies provide brief one-liners of what you can expect to build, while others will only state whether it's frontend/backend/etc. Regardless, it never hurts to ask what you can expect on the technical screen.

I've had technical screens last anywhere between 30 minutes to 1 hour. Here are some tips that can help you during the technical screen:

* Think out loud. This allows the interviewer to understand your thought process and why you're making certain decisions. If you're stuck, talking through your problem out loud might help, and it gives the interviewer a chance to nudge you in the right direction.
* If you don't know the answer to a question, don't bs it. It's okay to admit that you don't know something.
* Don't try to solve the entire problem in one go. Break it down into smaller problems and solve it piece by piece.

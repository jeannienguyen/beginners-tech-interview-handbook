# Behavioral

Behavioral interviews give the interviewers the opportunity to assess you in terms of culture fit, team fit, collaboration, and more.

Behavioral interviews are easy to prepare for. I find it best to have your projects/features listed out following the STAR method so you can efficiently answer the questions.

Here are some questions you may be asked:

* Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a coworker. How did you resolve it?
* Tell me about a project you've worked on. What went well? What could've gone better?
* Tell me about a time you've been given feedback. How did you handle it?

# Technical Interview

In my experience, the first technical screen and the final round technical interview can be similar, built on top of each other, or be completely unrelated. In all cases, you can try to get more information on each interview during your chat with the recruiter. Most of the time, you'll be sent an email for the final rounds that has a breakdown of each interview. If there's anything you're still unclear on, it doesn't hurt to ask for clarification.

I've found that the best interviewers make the technical interviews feel collaborative and similar to pair programming - to get a better understanding of how you would solve a problem and in work/team setting.

Technical interviews are usually between 30 minutes to 1 hour.

### Tips for the Technical Interview

* Pick the coding language you know best
* Brush up on the basics of the coding language you'll be writing in
* Break the problem down into smaller problems and go step by step
* Think out loud - the interviewer can't nudge you in the right direction if they don't know what you're trying to accomplish

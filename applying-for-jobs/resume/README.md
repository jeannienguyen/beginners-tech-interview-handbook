# Resume

Having a resume that accurately speaks to your skills is one of the most important things when it comes to getting an interview. You can be your company's best engineer, but unless you can display that through your resume/projects/etc, you might not get that first recruiter call.

Your resume doesn't have to look fancy - all it needs is your contact information, the technologies you've worked with, and the accomplishments you've achieved at the companies you've worked at (plus education, etc).

Here are some things to note when listing those bullet points under each company you've worked at:

* Instead of listing your responsibilities, list projects that you've worked on or features you've built that had a positive impact on the company
* Use numbers/percentages where you can - you want to be able to quantify your impact

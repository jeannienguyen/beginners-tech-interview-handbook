# Projects/Features

Sometimes you'll get asked about projects that you've worked on by recruiters. I find that most of the time, you get asked this question by the hiring manager + throughout the interview process. In any case, you'll want to come prepared with projects you've worked on that you can do a deep dive into.

I have a document that has all my big projects/features highlighted through the [STAR method](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629) for behavioral interviews and broken down by tech stack for technical interviews. This document is kept up to date while I'm employed so that I'm not hunting down my accomplishments in the future when I need it.

### Your First Job

If you're looking for your first role, here are some things I've found that can boost your visibility:

* Having a personal website
* Having personal projects that you've worked on and can discuss in detail
* Having a complete LinkedIn profile

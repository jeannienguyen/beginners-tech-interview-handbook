# Things to Consider

### **Know What You Want in Your Next Role**

Do you know what you want in your next role? Knowing what you want will help you determine which jobs are worth your time to apply for.&#x20;

Here are some questions I thought about when I started applying for jobs:

* Which industries am I interested in working in?
* What kind of projects do I want to work on?
* What tech stack do I want to work with?
* Do I want a frontend/backend/full-stack/etc role?
* What size team do I want to work on?
* Do I want to work at a startup/mid-size/large/etc company?
* What kind of culture do I thrive in?
* Do I want to work in a on-site, hybrid, or remote role?

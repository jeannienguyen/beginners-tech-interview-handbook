# Applying for Jobs

When it comes to applying for jobs, all you need is one offer. Depending on your situation, you may simply be looking for employment and are happy to take the first offer or you have a specific role and set of responsibilities you're looking for.&#x20;

Though some may suggest applying to as many jobs as possbile, I'm a fan of targeting the roles I feel I'm a best fit for. Applying to as many jobs as possible means the number of rejections will be higher. You only have so much time to apply for jobs each day, so why not put that effort into applying for jobs where you match at least 50% of the qualifications/asks for the role?

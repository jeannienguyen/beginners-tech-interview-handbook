# Tracking Your Applications

The second to last time I applied for jobs, I kept track of everything on an Excel sheet. If you can efficiently track your job applications, it doesn't matter how you're doing it. The last time I applied for jobs, I used a little nugget of knowledge from my 2 months at my last job. A coworker of mine introduced me to [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), an all-in-one workspace for essential work tools.

Notion has this really cool Job Applications template with a clean, easy-to-use interface that kept me on top of all my applications. All the information you need for your job hunt can live neatly on this one Notion page, ready to pull up at the click of a button. It's fully customizable, so you can edit it to fit your needs.

This template helped me keep track of key information such as:

* Company/role
* Job description
* Status of the application, date I applied for the job
* Upcoming deadlines
* Company-specific notes (ex: interview process, tech stack, hiring timeline, etc)

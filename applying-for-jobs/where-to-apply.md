# Where to Apply

Outside of referrals, I've always found my next job via LinkedIn. Here are a few ways I used the LinkedIn Job Search when applying for jobs:

* Search by title
  * (Associate/Mid-level/Senior/Frontend/Backend/Full Stack) Software Engineer
  * Growth Engineer
  * (Lead/Full Stack) Web Developer
* Search by Easy Apply
* Search by Date Posted
* Adjust location
  * Ex: Instead of just California, you can set location to United States (good for remote roles)
* On-site/Hybrid/Remote

Remember to apply even if you don't feel like you meet all the qualifications/asks. If you meet at least half of the qualifications, you should apply. The majority of applicants don't meet all the qualifications, so don't let that discourage you from applying. Don't self-reject!

### Other Ways To Apply

* Through referrals
  * I've personally found the most success from referrals & cold applying
* Connecting with recruiters
* Networking events

Outside of LinkedIn, here are a few sites I've applied through in the past and some additional ones my friends have used:

* [Built In](https://builtin.com/jobs)
* [AngelList](https://angel.co/) (good for startup jobs)
* [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)
* [Monster](https://www.monster.com/)
